    "* Normalize points and un-normalize $F$: You should scale the data by dividing each coordinate by $p_{\\text{max}}$ (the maximum of the image's width and height) using a transformation matrix $T$. After computing $F$, you will have to \"unscale\" the fundamental matrix. If $p_{\\text{norm}} = Tp$, then $F_{\\text{unnorm}} = T^T F T$. Note that this scaling is slightly simpler than \"centering\" that you did in the lecture, but for the purpose of this assingment it should suffice.\n",

Recall that a valid fundamental matrix $F$ will have all epipolar lines intersect at a certain point, meaning that there exists a non-trivial null space for $F$. In general, with real points, the eight-point solution for $F$ will not come with this condition. To enforce the rank 2 constraint, decompose $F$ with SVD to get the three matrices $U,\\Sigma,V$ such that $F = U\\Sigma V^T$. Then force the matrix to be rank 2 by setting the smallest singular value in $\\Sigma$ to zero, giving you a new $\\Sigma'$. Now compute the proper fundamental matrix with $F' = U\\Sigma' V^T$.\n",

This probably won't fix a completely broken solution, but may make a good solution better by locally minimizing a geometric cost function. For this we have provided a helper function `refineF` taking in $F$ and the two sets of points, which you can call from `eight_point` before unscaling $F$.\n",

This line, along with a second image's camera center $C'$ (the right view in Figure 2) forms a plane. This plane intersects with the image plane of the second camera, resulting in a line $l'$ in the second image which describes all the possible locations that $p$ may be found in the second image. Line $l'$ is the epipolar line, and we only need to search along this line to find a match for point $p$ found in the first image.\n",
